# TODO 1: Task
"""
Write a program that converts their scores to grades.
By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called
student_grades that should contain student names for keys
and their grades for values.

This is the scoring criteria:
Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"

    "Harry": 81,
    "Ron": 78,
    "Hermione": 99,
    "Draco": 74,
    "Neville": 62,
