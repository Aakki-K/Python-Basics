Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based
 on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI
 based on the BMI value.

    Under 18.5 they are underweight
    Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
    Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
    Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
    Above 35 they are clinically obese.
